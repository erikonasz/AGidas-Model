# AGidas-Model

Data analysis of 9,000 cars scraped from the website autogidas. It includes the creation of various charts to visually represent the insights gained from the data. The charts help to highlight the relationships between different variables and provide a clear understanding of the data. Additionally, an unfinished price prediction model has been developed to predict the prices of cars based on certain features. Despite being unfinished, the model shows great potential for further development and refinement to provide accurate predictions
